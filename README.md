# QCM-Drapeaux
The main objective of this project is to create a software with a pleasant graphical interface, allowing to help the user to learn national flags through multiple choice questions (MCQs). The user of this software should have the possibility to choose the difficulty of the questions, the type of question (flag to country or country to flag) as well as to see its statistics. Also, depending on the chosen difficulty, the questions asked should not be chosen randomly. Instead, it take into account your answers to previous MCQs in order to focus on your mistakes.
